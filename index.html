            <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
            <p>
               <b> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b>was an Indian aerospace scientist 
                and statesman who served as the president of India from 2002 to 2007.
                Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu,
                 Kalam studied physics and aerospace engineering. 
                 He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, 
                 mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
                 Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
                  India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. 
                  He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development 
                  of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal 
                  organisational, technical, and political role in Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
                   India's second such test after the first test in 1974.

                 Kalam was elected as the president of India in 2002 with the support of both 
                 the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress.
                  He was widely referred to as the "People's President". He engaged in teaching,
                 writing and public service after his presidency. He was a recipient of several
                 awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
